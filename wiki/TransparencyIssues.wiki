= Introduction =

There is some known transparency issues with the text that uses device fonts.


= Details =

For some reason (probably _`DrawText()`_) alpha for this pixels is set to zero, but color channels are OK. And even setting transparency mode to opaque don't fix the problem if you use *`A8R8G8B8`* texture or equivalent. Just don't use such fonts (use anti-aliased font or set *'cacheAsBitmap'* property of the object to true) if you want proper transparency. Otherwise use *`X8R8G8B8`* texture or any equivalent with disabled alpha channel.
