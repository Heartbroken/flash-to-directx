Few specific details to make calls between AS3 and C++.

= Details =

To make a call of C++ function from AS3 you need to make the following:
  * In C++ register function with _ASInterface::AddCallback(name_for_AS3, class, function)_;
  * Call function from AS3: _ExternalInterface.call(name_for_AS3, parameters)_;

To make a call of AS3 function from C++ you need to make the following:
  * Register AS3 function for external interface: _ExternalInterface.addCallback(name_for_C++, AS3_function)_;
  * Call function from C++: _ASInterface::Call(name_for_C++, parameters)_;

You can use any number of parameters for AS3 and C++ calls.
